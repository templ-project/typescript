# Google Bash Style Guide configuration

# Disable checks that conflict with the established codebase style
# SC1091: Can't follow non-constant source (sourced files with variables)
# SC2015: Note that A && B || C is not if-then-else (used intentionally for concise logic)
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately (codebase uses combined declare/assign)
# SC2250: Preffer puting braces around variables even when not required
# SC2310: This function is invoked in an 'if' condition so set -e will be disabled
# SC2311: Bash implicitly disabled set -e for this function invocation
# SC2312: Consider invoking this command separately to avoid masking its return value
